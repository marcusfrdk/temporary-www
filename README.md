# Temporary Website
This is really only a simple temporary website I use in order to provide some information until the full released website is live.

## Technology
The Website is built using Svelte with Typescript.

## How to use
```
$ git clone https://github.com/marcusfrdk/temporary-www.git
$ cd temporary-www
$ npm install (or) yarn install
$ npm run build (or) yarn build
$ npm run start (or) yarn start
```
